	Dealing with a serious medical professional error or act of negligence can leave you and your family feeling frustrated, overwhelmed and searching for answers. Hospital visits, doctor appointments, surgeries – we put our health and trust in the hands of medical professionals every day. We assume they will administer competent, safe care to diagnose and treat our conditions. Yet sometimes breakdowns happen, whether due to an individual’s mistake or broader systemic issues, resulting in patients getting injured rather than healed.

<p>
	If you or someone you love suffered harm under a healthcare provider’s care in the Bellevue area, you may feel confused about where to turn or what options you have. People who are already dealing with physical trauma, emotional stress, mounting medical bills and other losses are often reluctant to assert their rights. It seems easier to just move on. However, in many cases working with an experienced medical malpractice lawyer can help patients and families obtain justice, crucial compensation and create positive changes.

<p>
	Medical malpractice occurs when a healthcare professional or organization breaches their duty of care, causing a patient injury or harm. Some examples of medical malpractice attorneys include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Misdiagnosing or failing to diagnose a condition</li>
	<li>Surgical mistakes and errors made during procedures</li>
	<li>Not recognizing symptoms on time or delaying treatment</li>
	<li>Childbirth injuries to mother or baby</li>
	<li>Administering the wrong medication or wrong dose</li>
	<li>Using defective medical devices that malfunction</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In essence, the provider did not live up to the accepted standard of care, and this negligence resulted in damages. Just because you had a bad outcome does not automatically equate to a medical malpractice lawsuit. Within the healthcare field, there are always inherent risks and complications with tests, drugs, surgery and other interventions. However, if a provider makes an egregious, preventable error that harms you, or ignores safety protocols, you may have a valid claim.
</p>
<p>
	Some examples of potential malpractice scenarios:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A doctor fails to order cancer screening tests for a patient displaying obvious symptoms</li>
	<li>Surgeons operate on the wrong area of a patient’s body</li>
	<li>An ER doctor misdiagnoses appendicitis as stomach flu, resulting in a burst appendix</li>
	<li>OBGYN prescribes a harmful drug to a pregnant patient despite potential fetal risks</li>
	<li>A nurse administers a nearly fatal overdose of medication in error</li>
</ul>
<p>
	These types of clear-cut breaches of care are more likely to warrant a malpractice suit than cases of judgment errors or complications that do not severely harm the patient. Regardless of specific circumstances, a lawyer can advise if you have grounds to pursue a claim.

<p>
	Suing a doctor, hospital or healthcare system is no easy feat. These organizations almost always dedicate immense legal and financial resources to deflect blame and avoid malpractice liability. They know most patients lack the expertise and stamina to prove negligence. An accomplished malpractice firm levels this playing field.
</p>
<strong class="heading4">We Know How to Build Strong Medical Negligence Cases</strong>
<p>
	Medical malpractice cases hinge on understanding medicine. The plaintiff must demonstrate, often through expert testimony that the defendant’s actions fell below recognized standards of care. Our firm retains the most reputable specialists in practice areas related to a client’s injury, whether it is a neurosurgeon, pediatrician, emergency physician, obstetrician, or other expert. These medical experts review all pertinent records to provide opinions about improper treatment and other breaches. Their involvement lends credibility when going up against major hospitals and healthcare providers during settlement negotiations or at trial.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">We Have Resources to Thoroughly Investigate System Failures</strong>
<p>
	Beyond individuals, sometimes negligence arises from problematic institutional policies, inadequate safety protocols, insufficient staffing, faulty equipment or other system-wide failures. These can become apparent after meticulously digging into case specifics. Large verdicts and settlements happen when lawyers comprehensively identify all players and failures that contributed to patient harm. Our team devotes substantial resources to gather and examine every shred of relevant evidence.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">We Handle Complex Liability Scenarios</strong>
<p>
	Cases involving multiple defendants, alternative theories of liability or questions over who bears responsibility require deft navigation. For example, a mistake during surgery could implicate the surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses, device manufacturer or even the cleaning crew. Our lawyers establish innovative arguments regarding accountability when warranted and strategically approach settlement talks. We pursue compensation from all viable liable parties.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">We Know How to Maximize Damages Recovery</strong>
<p>
	Proving liability is crucial, but malpractice cases also hinge on the attorney effectively showcasing damages. This means quantifying and documenting every related medical cost, lost income, lowered quality of life due to disability, pain and suffering, and other losses stemming from the malpractice. An experienced lawyer makes sure you receive full compensation.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">We Have a Proven Record Against Major Healthcare Systems</strong>
<p>
	Our firm has successfully taken on some of the largest, most prominent hospitals and healthcare networks in Washington and across the United States. We do not back down from challenging powerful defendants when our clients’ rights have been violated. Over our decades of practice, we have leveraged millions in verdicts and settlements for those harmed by medical negligence nationwide. Our credentials add credibility.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to explore a potential malpractice claim with legal counsel who brings extensive and experienced medical malpractice attorney expertise and resources to the table, our Bellevue firm has the skills to build a strong case on your behalf.
</p>
<strong class="heading4">Examples of Common Medical Negligence Cases</strong>
<p>
	While every medical malpractice claim often involves unique circumstances, some types of healthcare errors arise more frequently than others. Patients come to our Bellevue law office seeking representation for a variety of potential cases, including:
</p>
<strong class="heading5">Medication Errors</strong>
<p>
	From a pharmacist filling the wrong prescription to a nurse giving an improper drug dose in the hospital, medication mistakes cause countless injuries each year. Medication errors typically happen due to oversight, miscommunication or failure to verify a drug’s identity before administering it. They can involve giving the incorrect medication, incorrect dosage, or neglecting to notice possible drug interactions. Those harmed may have grounds for a malpractice claim.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">Failure to Diagnose</strong>
<p>
	One of the top allegations in malpractice suits involves failure to diagnose, detect or treat a condition in a timely manner. This often pertains to physicians missing clear symptoms of cancer or other life-threatening illness during exams. But it also applies to situations like an emergency physician failing to recognize signs of imminent heart attack or stroke. Failure to diagnose cases center on whether quicker action could have led to better patient outcomes.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">Childbirth Injuries</strong>
<p>
	When poor decisions or errors are made during prenatal care, labor, delivery or postpartum care, infants sometimes sustain injuries like brain damage, cerebral palsy or nerve damage. Mothers can also experience harm from Ob-gyn errors and negligence, such as hysterectomies after delivery. Our lawyers handle birth injury cases involving flawed medical judgment, failure to monitor fetal distress, improper use of delivery devices and other mistakes.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">Surgical Errors</strong>
<p>
	With millions of surgeries occurring in the U.S. yearly, some degree of errors are inevitable. However, surgeries involving egregious errors like operating on the wrong body part, leaving foreign objects inside patients, puncturing organs, anesthesia mistakes and preventable infections may constitute the most medical malpractice claims. Surgical errors can cause severe harm.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">Nursing Home Abuse or Neglect</strong>
<p>
	Elderly nursing home residents heavily rely on staff for their basic health and safety needs. When overworked or negligent staff fails to provide adequate care, the consequences can be devastating. Bed sores, falls, malnutrition, dehydration, emotional abuse and physical assault in nursing homes happen too frequently. Seeking justice is complex but possible.
</p>
<strong class="heading5">Medical Device Injuries</strong>
<p>
	When defective medical products like transvaginal mesh, pacemakers, hip implants and IVC filters malfunction, patients can sustain life-altering damage. Our firm handles device injury cases against manufacturers while holding providers accountable for improperly using devices or failing to recognize complications.
</p>
<p>
	No matter how unique or complex your circumstances, our goal is determining whether negligence occurred and if so, compiling evidence to prove where the healthcare provider breached their duty of care. Connecting with knowledgeable counsel early is essential.
